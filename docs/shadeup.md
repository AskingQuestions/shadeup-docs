# What is Shadeup?

Shadeup aims to do the following:

1. Generate an Unreal Engine shader setup within seconds via the CLI
2. Provide a learning resource for UE-specific graphics patterns and APIs

The latter is accomplished mostly through comments in the code Shadeup generates. However, I'd like to organize and get those comments and patterns into these docs in the future.

As for now, this site contains very surface-level information to help guide you along while generating the various templates Shadeup provides.
